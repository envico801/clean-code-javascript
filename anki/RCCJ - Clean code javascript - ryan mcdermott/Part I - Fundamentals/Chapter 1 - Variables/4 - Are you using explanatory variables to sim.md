========== Question ==========  

### Are you using explanatory variables to simplify complex expressions?

Look at this code. What makes it hard to understand?

```javascript
const address = 'One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014';
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
saveCityZipCode(
    address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[1],
    address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[2],
);
```

Think about:

-   How many times is the regex match performed?

-   What do the array indices [1] and [2] represent?

-   How could we make this code more readable?

========== Answer ==========  

**The Principle**:

Break down complex expressions into smaller, well-named parts to make the code's intent clear and avoid repeating operations.

**Solution**:

```javascript
const address = 'One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014';
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
const [_, city, zipCode] = address.match(cityZipCodeRegex) || [];
saveCityZipCode(city, zipCode);
```

**Why is this better?**

We've used destructuring to give meaningful names to the regex matches and eliminated repeated operations. Each part of the code now clearly shows its purpose.
