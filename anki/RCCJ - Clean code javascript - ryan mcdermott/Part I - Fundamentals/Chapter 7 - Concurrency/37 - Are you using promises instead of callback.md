========== Question ==========  

### Are you using Promises instead of callbacks?

Look at this code. What problems do you see with this approach?

```javascript
import { get } from 'request';
import { writeFile } from 'fs';

get(
    'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin',
    (requestErr, response, body) => {
        if (requestErr) {
            console.error(requestErr);
        } else {
            writeFile('article.html', body, (writeErr) => {
                if (writeErr) {
                    console.error(writeErr);
                } else {
                    console.log('File written');
                }
            });
        }
    },
);
```

Think about:

-   How easy is it to follow the flow of operations?

-   What happens to the indentation as more callbacks are added?

-   How scattered is the error handling?

========== Answer ==========  

**The Principle**:

Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks. They help avoid "callback hell" (deeply nested callbacks) and provide better error-handling mechanisms. Promises make asynchronous code more readable and maintainable.

**Solution**:

Here's a better way to write it:

```javascript
import { get } from 'request-promise';
import { writeFile } from 'fs-extra';

get('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin')
    .then((body) => {
        return writeFile('article.html', body);
    })
    .then(() => {
        console.log('File written');
    })
    .catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

**Why is this better?**

The Promise chain creates a flat structure that's easier to read and maintain. Error handling is consolidated into a single `.catch()` block, making the code more concise and clearer.
