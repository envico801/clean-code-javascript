========== Question ==========  

### Are you avoiding premature optimization?

Premature optimization can lead to harder-to-maintain code without providing meaningful performance benefits. Modern JavaScript engines are highly sophisticated and handle many optimizations automatically.

Key principles:

-   Trust the JavaScript engine's built-in optimizations

-   Focus on writing clear, maintainable code first

-   Only optimize after profiling identifies actual bottlenecks

-   Consider browser compatibility when optimizing

**Bad:**

```javascript
// On old browsers, each iteration with uncached `list.length` would be costly
// because of `list.length` recomputation. In modern browsers, this is optimized.
for (let i = 0, len = list.length; i < len; i++) {
    // ...
}
```  

========== Answer ==========  

Write clean, straightforward code and let the JavaScript engine handle optimizations. Modern browsers are smart enough to optimize common operations efficiently.

**Good:**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    // ...
}
```
