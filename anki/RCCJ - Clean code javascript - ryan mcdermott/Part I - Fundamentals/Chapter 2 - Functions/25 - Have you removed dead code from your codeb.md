========== Question ==========  

### Have you removed dead code from your codebase?

Dead code is code that's no longer used but remains in the codebase. It creates confusion, increases maintenance burden, and can lead to bugs. Version control systems like Git already maintain your code history, making it safe to remove unused code.

Key reasons to remove dead code:

-   Reduces cognitive load when reading code

-   Decreases maintenance burden

-   Prevents confusion about which code path is actually used

-   Makes the codebase smaller and more manageable

**Bad:**

```javascript
function oldRequestModule(url) {
    // ...
}

function newRequestModule(url) {
    // ...
}

const req = newRequestModule;
inventoryTracker('apples', req, 'www.inventory-awesome.io');
```  

========== Answer ==========  

Keep only the code that's actively being used. If you need to reference old code later, you can always find it in your version control history.

**Good:**

```javascript
function newRequestModule(url) {
    // ...
}

const req = newRequestModule;
inventoryTracker('apples', req, 'www.inventory-awesome.io');
```
