========== Question ==========  

### Have you removed dead code from your codebase?

Look at this code. What's wrong with it?

```javascript
function oldRequestModule(url) {
    // ...
}

function newRequestModule(url) {
    // ...
}

const req = newRequestModule;
inventoryTracker('apples', req, 'www.inventory-awesome.io');
```

<details><summary>üîç Hints</summary>

Think about:

-   Which functions are actually being used?

-   What happens if someone tries to use the old function?

-   How does keeping unused code affect maintainability?

-   Where can you find old code if you need it later?

</details>  

========== Answer ==========  

**The Principle**:

Dead code is code that's no longer used but remains in the codebase. It creates confusion, increases maintenance burden, and can lead to bugs. Version control systems like Git already maintain your code history, making it safe to remove unused code.

Key reasons to remove dead code:

-   Reduces cognitive load when reading code

-   Decreases maintenance burden

-   Prevents confusion about which code path is actually used

-   Makes the codebase smaller and more manageable

**Solution**:

```javascript
function newRequestModule(url) {
    // ...
}

const req = newRequestModule;
inventoryTracker('apples', req, 'www.inventory-awesome.io');
```

**Why is this better?**

-   Clearer intent - only shows what's actually being used

-   Reduces confusion for other developers

-   Smaller, more maintainable codebase

-   Old code is still available in version control if needed
