========== Question ==========  

### Are you avoiding premature optimization?

Look at this code. What's wrong with it?

```javascript
// On old browsers, each iteration with uncached `list.length` would be costly
// because of `list.length` recomputation. In modern browsers, this is optimized.
for (let i = 0, len = list.length; i < len; i++) {
    // ...
}
```

<b>Think about</b>:

-   Is this optimization actually necessary in modern browsers?

-   What's more important: code readability or micro-optimizations?

-   How do modern JavaScript engines handle loop optimizations?

-   Are we making assumptions about performance without measuring?

</details>  

========== Answer ==========  

**The Principle**:

Premature optimization can lead to harder-to-maintain code without providing meaningful performance benefits. Modern JavaScript engines are highly sophisticated and handle many optimizations automatically. Focus on writing clear, maintainable code first.

Key principles:

-   Trust the JavaScript engine's built-in optimizations

-   Focus on writing clear, maintainable code first

-   Only optimize after profiling identifies actual bottlenecks

-   Consider browser compatibility when optimizing

**Solution**:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    // ...
}
```

**Why is this better?**

-   More readable and straightforward

-   Modern browsers optimize this automatically

-   No premature optimization

-   Easier to maintain
