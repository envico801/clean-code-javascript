========== Question ==========  

### Are you adhering to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP)?

Look at this code. What problems do you see with its design?

```javascript
class AjaxAdapter extends Adapter {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.name = 'ajaxAdapter';
    }
}

class NodeAdapter extends Adapter {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.name = 'nodeAdapter';
    }
}

class HttpRequester {
    constructor(adapter) {
        this.adapter = adapter;
    }

    fetch(url) {
        if (this.adapter.name === 'ajaxAdapter') {
            return makeAjaxCall(url).then((response) => {
                // transform response and return
            });
        } else if (this.adapter.name === 'nodeAdapter') {
            return makeHttpCall(url).then((response) => {
                // transform response and return
            });
        }
    }
}

function makeAjaxCall(url) {
    // request and return promise
}

function makeHttpCall(url) {
    // request and return promise
}
```

Think about:

-   What happens if you need to add a new type of adapter?

-   How many places would you need to modify the code?

-   Is there a way to make the code more flexible?

-   How could you avoid checking the adapter type?

========== Answer ==========  

**The Principle**:

The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code, typically achieved through inheritance and polymorphism.

**Solution**:

Here's a better approach:

```javascript
class AjaxAdapter extends Adapter {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.name = 'ajaxAdapter';
    }

    request(url) {
        // request and return promise
    }
}

class NodeAdapter extends Adapter {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.name = 'nodeAdapter';
    }

    request(url) {
        // request and return promise
    }
}

class HttpRequester {
    constructor(adapter) {
        this.adapter = adapter;
    }

    fetch(url) {
        return this.adapter.request(url).then((response) => {
            // transform response and return
        });
    }
}
```

**Why is this better?**

1. Each adapter implements a common interface (the request method)

2. New adapters can be added without modifying the HttpRequester class

3. The system is now extensible through inheritance and polymorphism

4. No need for if/else statements checking adapter types
